how i spent time
--------------------
device name was hardcoded in code..now its dynamically fetched from APIs via user prompt +  nlp


many static things /hardcoded were removed and dynamic api fetch


google gemini pro api  was giivng issue.it was fized and as fallback option open api was added

login screen was not dynamically working with jwt (dummy users) lot of time got wasted in it..finaly rmeoved login screen..will do later.
