## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: You Ask a Question**
```
Hotel Manager: "Why is the east wing warm and noisy today?"
```

### **Step 2: AI Understands and Acts**
```
AI Agent: "Let me check the systems and find out what's happening..."
```

### **Step 3: AI Gets the Information**
```
AI Agent: "I found the issue! The HVAC system in the east wing is 
underperforming, causing the temperature to rise by 4°C above normal. 
There's also elevated fan noise from Air Handling Unit 2."
```

### **Step 4: AI Suggests Solutions**
```
AI Agent: "Would you like me to:
1. Schedule maintenance for the HVAC system?
2. Adjust the temperature settings?
3. Send an alert to the engineering team?"
```

---

## 🎯 Real Examples

### **Example 1: Energy Management**
```
You: "Turn off HVAC and dim lights in the east wing for the weekend"

AI: "✅ Confirmed. HVAC turned off, Lights dimmed to 30% in East Wing. 
Weekend schedule applied. A detailed energy savings report will be 
delivered Monday at 8 AM."
```

### **Example 2: Guest Comfort**
```
You: "Increase temperature by 2 degrees in room 101 for the next 3 hours"

AI: "✅ Temperature settings updated for Room 101. Increased by 2°C 
for 3 hours. Reverting to default settings at 12 AM. Monitoring 
will continue in case of further changes."
```

### **Example 3: Predictive Maintenance**
```
You: "Are any HVAC systems likely to fail in the next 7 days?"

AI: "⚠️ Yes. Chiller 2 in Zone 3 showing early signs of compressor 
strain, LED driver in Main Hall showing voltage fluctuations. 
Would you like to schedule maintenance?"
```

### **Example 4: Sustainability Reporting**
```
You: "How much carbon emissions did we reduce this week?"

AI: "📊 You've reduced 1.2 metric tons of CO₂ this week. Progress 
is at 78% toward the Q3 reduction goal. A detailed report has 
been emailed to your sustainability team."
