## 🚀 **Real Examples - Show These to Clients**

### **Example 1: Autonomous Alarm Management**
```
User: "What's the highest severity alarm right now?"
Agent: [Autonomously decides to]
→ Call alarm API tool
→ Filter for current day only
→ Sort by severity level
→ Format response with actions
→ Store context for future
```

### **Example 2: Intelligent Device Control**
```
User: "Room 50 2nd floor ka temperature kya hai?"
Agent: [Autonomously decides to]
→ Extract location from Hinglish
→ Match device in database
→ Call temperature API
→ Include device ID in response
→ Remember user's device preference
```

### **Example 3: Proactive Energy Optimization**
```
Agent: [Autonomously monitors]
→ Analyzes energy patterns
→ Identifies optimization opportunities
→ Suggests load balancing
→ Alerts users to anomalies
→ Takes preventive actions
```
