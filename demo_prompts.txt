You can use the following API to write data into a device point, for example, to set the "fan speed status" to 0:

`/api/plugins/telemetry/{entityType}/{entityId}/timeseries/{scope}` - Save or update time series data (saveEntityTelemetry)

Available metrics: heartbeat, mode status, device monitor, set fan speed, fan speed status, room temperature setpoint, room temperature, thermostat status.

???temperature of device is not same as room temperature !!!!

Your AI agent should not assume only "DEVICE"‚Äîit should dynamically use the entityType from the API data.
This makes your system robust and future-proof for all Inferrix entity types.
If you want, I can help you review or update your backend logic to ensure it dynamically handles all entityType values for any user prompt.


Summary of Backend Flow
Extract device type, action, and location from the user prompt.
Fetch all devices and their attributes.
Match the device type and location to find the correct device.
Send the telemetry update (or fetch status) using the correct API endpoint and headers.

Fetch all entities (devices, assets, thermostats, etc.) relevant to the user‚Äôs prompt.
For each entity, check:
entityType (e.g., "DEVICE", "ASSET", "Thermostat")
name, type, location, and other attributes
Match the user‚Äôs intent (e.g., ‚Äúfan‚Äù, ‚Äúthermostat‚Äù, ‚Äúoffice device‚Äù, ‚Äúasset‚Äù) and location to the correct entity.
Use the correct entityType and entityId in your API call.
